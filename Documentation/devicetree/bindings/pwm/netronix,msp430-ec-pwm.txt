PWM functionality in MSP430-based Netronix Embedded Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "netronix,msp430-ec-pwm"
- #pwm-cells: Should be 1.

Available PWM channels:
- 0: The PWM channel controlled by registers 0xa1-0xa7

Example:

	embedded-controller@43 {
		compatible = "netronix,msp430-ec";
		...

		ec_pwm: pwm {
			compatible = "netronix,msp430-ec-pwm";
			#pwm-cells = <1>;
		};
	};

	...

	backlight {
		compatible = "pwm-backlight";
		pwms = <&ec_pwm 0 50000>;
	};
